# Our Rituals

## Company Retreats
A company retreat is when we get most, if not the entire team together in one physical location for a week at a time. We try to do this at least once a year. Ideally, the location is somewhere that we can all enjoy, be it tropical or mountainous, the location should instill a sense of inspiration and bring the team closer together through shared experiences. 

Full-time employees are expected to attend these meetups as they're a crucial time for us all to converge and get on the same page, while also being a starting point for many future initiatives. We understand if there's a pre-scheduled conflict, and we recognize that these meetups can be exhausting (and exhilarating), but we ask that all efforts be made to attend.

Part-time employees are welcome and encouraged to attend.

## Individual Meetups
Since we're spread all over the world we encourage all crew members to connect in person whenever paths cross. Do not be afraid to reach out and propose a meetup should you be in another member's territory.
