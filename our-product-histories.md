As a team we have created multiple products and services. These collectively make up CG Cookie as both a company and a brand.

## CG Cookie (https://cgcookie.com)
The one and only, the site that started it all. CG Cookie launched in 2008 began as a software agnostic content site built with Wordpress and a purchased theme. Featuring tutorials, gallery and conversations on various softwares. CG Cookie offered training on 3D modeling with Blender, game development with Unity, concept art with Photoshop and even sculpting with real clay. 

Originally selling individual tutorials for $4, CG Cookie began to take hold after being one of the first to market Blender 2.5 training DVD. Shortly thereafter we launched our Citizen paid membership November 2010. 

In 2017 CG Cookie transitioned away from a heavy Wordpress site to a fully custom built Ruby on Rails CMS. A CMS that we’ve iterated a few times on and was the spark to create the Mavenseed Project. 

We’ve come to recognize our super power is within the software Blender and are passionate about supporting this free open-source community that has supported us. 

In 2019 CG Cookie pivoted to be a Blender focused project.

## BlenderMarket (https://blendermarket.com)
Blender Market was launched by CG Cookie in June 2014, is a place where Blender artists are able to elevate their passion for Blender into a career. Our vision was to create a sustainable and stable environment for developers & artists, allowing them to get paid for doing what they love creating custom tools, and incentivizing them to deliver assets and add-ons that are invaluable to the community. 

Our built-in features allow Blender Market creators to automatically donate a percentage of their earnings directly back to the Fund. This means that making a purchase on the Blender Market not only supports a creator but also helps make Blender better than ever before.

We believe that Blender’s future is to become the most widely used 3D software package on the planet. The role of Blender Market is to give our community a trusted platform for making a living using the software that we all love, Blender.

## Mavenseed (http://mavenseed.com)
Launched by CG Cookie and Nick Haskins in 2019. Mavenseed is essentially the next CMS build for CG Cookie. We’re scratching our own itch, while opening it up to enable other creators to build their own CG Cookie, digital product, landing page or online community.

This has helped us create the Cookie ecosystem: Members come to CG Cookie to pick up knowledge. They then apply what they’ve learned creating their first product on the Blender Market. From there, members looking to take it to the next level can build the entire business on the Mavenseed platform. 

## RetopoFlow (https://blendermarket.com/products/retopoflow)
A retopology suite for Blender launched in 2015 helps you create clean topology in minutes versus hours, and no more painful and slow process. Instead, focus where it counts: your mesh flow and final topology.

## Extra Lights (https://blendermarket.com/products/extra-lights)
Launched in 2020 was the first new plugin a part of our employee shared development program. This plugin for Blender adds over 60 photometric light presets to your Add menu. 

## anAtomic (https://blendermarket.com/products/anatomic-ecorche-bust)
Launched in 2020 this add-on is a 3D facial anatomy resource for artists. 

## Eat Sheep - *retired*
A passion game project from the Cookie crew in 2012. A top down iPad puzzle/strategy game where you are charged with navigating your monster around the world consuming sheep to save the world. 

## SculptBox - *retired*
Launched by CGC in 2017 was our all-in-one clay sculpting starter kit that paired nicely with our online digital training. It was a fun side project, though ultimately was closed in 2019

## Midnight Realm Coffee - *retired*
A 2017 passion side project partnered with Fresh Ground Roast in Geneva, IL was to create amazing coffee while driving donations to art charities. For the sake of focus we closed this project in 2019 as well. 

## Art of Blender - *retired*
In 2013 Cg Cookie set out to create a high-quality printed art book featuring the best of Blender at the time from artists arond the globe. This 150 page hard cover book was self-published and printed. A large undertaking that was an incredible learning experience.
