# FAQS

## Who do I talk to if I have a problem?

If the problem relates to your specific role, or your work, first chat with your lead, they're your first point of contact. 

Issues that aren't able to be solved by your lead can be brought to Jonathan or Wes.


## What do I do if I have a problem with another team member?

If the problem is personnel based, such as a disagreement between two employees, or an issue with another's behavior, then the first step is to *talk directly* with that person. Fair and honest communication is essential.

As a remote company we tend to communicate through text a lot, which leaves out 98% of the communication. The vast majority of issues can be resolved by simply jumping on a call and talking it out.

Should the problem need a third-party arbitrator, or if it's a sensitive matter, then bring it up with Wes or Jonathan.

## How I report a bug, or request an enhancement for one of our websites/tools?

All bug reports go to the relevant Github repository Issues page. Before reporting a bug please be sure it's a legitimate bug, as opposed to a difference in expectation. Also please ensure that you have the steps to replicate this bug, as this will help expedite fixes. If the issue is expectation based, or is an enhancement request, then it may warrant a discussion on Basecamp.

For more information on procedures for reporting bugs and requesting enhancements, please refer to the [Engineering Handbook](https://github.com/CGCookie/engineering-handbook/blob/master/procedures.md).

## Where do I find internal documentation for a project or team?

Team and Project documentation belongs on Basecamp. Each project has a Documents section with folders for the various categories of documentation.

As an example, Customer Support guides and documentation is found on the [Customer Support Team Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/3093149/buckets/546109/vaults/648246931).

## How can I make suggestions or discuss a problem with this handbook?

You can report problems with the Handbook by [creating an Issue](https://github.com/cgcookie/handbook/issues) here on Github.

If the issue has already been discussed and instead you want to make changes then you can simply edit the corresponding file and then submit is as Pull Request. Pull Requests can then be discussed further if necessary.

Changes to the handbook should be approved by Jonathan and Wes prior to merging.

## Where did the name CG Cookie come from?

Wes spent too much time on trains dreaming about warm oatmeal cookies. Not really, but it makes for a silly story.

## But really, where did the CG Cookie name come from?

Jonathan, whom is writing this, has no memory of the source.
