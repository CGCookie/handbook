## Putting family first
A good work/life balance is crucial to health and happiness and so we aim to improve that balance in everything we do. From a [4-day work week](https://github.com/CGCookie/handbook/blob/master/how-we-work.md#4-day-work-week) to [retirement savings and health insurance](https://github.com/CGCookie/handbook/blob/master/benefits.md#employee-benefits). We believe giving priority to family will produce better more meaningful work at CG Cookie. 

## Working on things that matter
While not everything we do will always be fun, our goal is to improve both our customers lives and our own through the work we do. This includes providing platforms for independent success, culturing art and happiness, and overall simply working on things that bring each of us joy.

## Empowering individual success
While we feel CG Cookie is a place where you can hang your hat for a long term career, our goal is to help each employee grow personally and professionally. Through open communicaiton of your aspirations, whether those are with CG Cookie, or preparing you for the next chapter.

## Living where we choose
Thanks to the digital domain, our work is remote and our customers come from every country on earth. There's no reason to force all employees to live in a single area and so we actively encourage everyone to seek out the place (or places) that makes them happy. This is made possible through dedicated, open communication within the team. 

We will never require re-location for the sake of a job.
