## Putting family first
Each of our individual families will always come before work. A good work/life balance is crucial to health and happiness and so we aim to improve that balance in everything we do. From a [4-day work week](https://github.com/CGCookie/handbook/blob/master/how-we-work.md#4-day-work-week) to [retirement savings and health insurance](https://github.com/CGCookie/handbook/blob/master/benefits.md#employee-benefits), our first priority is to take care of ourselves and our family first. 

## Working on things that matter
While not everything we do will always be fun, our goal is to literally improve both our customers lives and our own through the work we do. This includes providing them a platform for independent success, culturing art and happiness, and overall simply working on things that bring us joy.
