## Putting family first
Each of our individual families will always come before work. A good work/life balance is crucial to health and happiness and so we aim to improve that balance in everything we do. From a [4-day work week](https://github.com/CGCookie/handbook/blob/master/how-we-work.md#4-day-work-week) to [retirement savings and health insurance](https://github.com/CGCookie/handbook/blob/master/benefits.md#employee-benefits), our first priority is to take care of ourselves and our family first. 

## Working on things that matter
While not everything we do will always be fun, our goal is to literally improve both our customers lives and our own through the work we do. This includes providing platforms for independent success, culturing art and happiness, and overall simply working on things that bring each of us joy.

Life is too short to be miserable at work.

## Empowering individual success
CG Cookie should never be a dead-end job, no matter if this becomes your permanent home or is simply a step to great paths. Our goal is to help each and every one of you grow personally and professionally. 

## Living where we choose
Thanks to the digital domain, our work is remote and our customers come from every country on earth. There's no reason to force all employees to live in a single area and so we actively encourage everyone to seek out the place (or places) that makes them happy.

We will never require re-location for the sake of a job.
