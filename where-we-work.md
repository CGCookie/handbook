## Remotely, from anywhere we like (with internet)

The CG Cookie crew is spread across the world! We are a remote company, by design, such that we are each
enabled and empowered to live in the place that makes us happy. Be that in the plains of Kansas or the
mountains of North Carolina, the only real requirement is that we each have a steady internet connection.

Being remote, though, we have to work harder to ensure we're properly communicating. One way do this is through annual, or bi-annual retreats.

## Company Retreats

A company retreat is when we get most, if not the entire team together in one physical location for a week at a time. We try to do this at least once a year. Ideally the location is somewhere that we can all enjoy, be it tropical or mountainous, the location should instill a sense of inspiration and bring the team closer together through shared experiences. *Sometimes these retreats are held at the CG Cookie office in Geneva IL for the sake of planning and cost-savings.*

Full-time employees are expected to attend these meetups as they're a crucial time for us all to converge and get on the same page, while also being a starting point for many future initiatives. We understand if there's a pre-scheduled conflict, and we recognize that these meetups can be exhausting (and exhilarating), but we ask that all efforts be made to attend.  

Part-tiime employees are welcome, and encouraged to attend.

## Individual Meetups

Since we're spread all over the world we encourage all crew members to connect in person whenever paths cross. Do not be afraid to reach out and propose a meetup should you be in another member's territory.
