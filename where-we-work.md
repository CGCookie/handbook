## Remotely, from anywhere we like (with internet)

The CG Cookie crew is spread across the world! We are a remote company, by design, such that we are each
enabled and empowered to live in the place that makes us happy. Be that in the plains of Kansas or the
mountains of North Carolina, the only real requirement is that we each have a steady internet connection.

Being remote, though, we have to work harder to ensure we're properly communicating. One way do this is through annual, or bi-annual retreats.
