Every company is different, but here at CG Cookie we work very hard to ensure that *how* we work not only yields great
results but also that our methods lead satisfying work that we can all be proud of.

## Remotely
With the exception of the occasional meetup all of our work is done remotely. 

We use a variety of tools to manage collaboration, but the key few are these:

* [Slack](https://slack.com) is our real-time chat system for day-to-day communication. Nothing in Slack is considered permanent, and thus nothing important should go in Slack. Anything that should be recorded goes to Basecamp.
* [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) is our overall team and project management system. Basecamp is where major updates are posted, ongoing discussions shared, and goals are set. It is the defacto hub for all things CG Cookie.
* [Github](https://github.com) is where all code lives. It is the version control and issue tracking system for code projects, including web sites, Blender add-ons, and yes, even this handbook.
* [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) is our file-sharing and syncing service, for which we have a team account. All content production and design files are hosted through Dropbox, ensuring the entire team can access them at any time.
