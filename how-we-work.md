Every company is different, but here at CG Cookie we work very hard to ensure that *how* we work not only yields great
results but also that our methods lead satisfying work that we can all be proud of.

## Remote tools we use
With the exception of the occasional meetup all of our work is done remotely. We use a variety of tools to manage collaboration, but the key few are these:

* [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) is our overall team and project management system. Basecamp is where major updates are posted, ongoing discussions shared, and goals are set. **It is the defacto hub for all things CG Cookie.**
* [Slack](https://slack.com) is our real-time chat system for day-to-day communication. Nothing in Slack is considered permanent, and thus nothing important should go in Slack. Anything that should be recorded goes to Basecamp.
* [Github](https://github.com) is where all code lives. It is the version control and issue tracking system for code projects, including web sites, Blender add-ons, and yes, even this handbook.
* [Helpscout](https://helpscout.com) is our customer support tool, enabling usto use email and in-app messaging tools.
* [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) is our file-sharing and syncing service, for which we have a team account. All content production and design files are hosted through Dropbox, ensuring the entire team can access them at any time.
* **Email** While not used as frequently as above, it's expected to check ideally once a day for edge case notifications and conversations. 

## Autonomously
A priority for all CG Cookie employees, is a strong-sense of self-drive and ability to work autonomously. We don't hire people managers, we hire *team members*. We're not interested in any kind of micro-management and should be avaoided at all costs.

We strive to enable everyone to work effectively, and happily, driven largely by their own initiative.

## Asynchronously
Being spread across the world, in many different time-zones, all of our work is done asyncrounously. We don't have specified office hours, even though the majority of the team overlaps by at least six hours.

We don't have specified daily office hours, though in general, we work Monday through Thursday during the day.

With this in mind [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/3093149/projects) is the default place for all discussions, pitches, and updates. In general responses to discussions happen within 48hrs, unless otherwise if the author has set a deadline for a response.
