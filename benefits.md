# Employee Benefits

These benefits apply to all W2 employees.

## Medical and Dental Health Care

We're proud to cover 100% of your health insurance cost through our PPO group plan with Blue Cross Blue Shield. This means we take care of the monthly cost for you (and your family) to have health insurance.

Should you need to use that insurance, you may be responsible for small deductibles and co-pays, but otherwise know that you're financial well-being is secure should a tragedy occur.

## Vision



## 401K Retirement Plan

CG Cookie offers a matching 401k retirement plan, where we will match up to 3%. This means if you contribute 3% of your bi-weekly paycheck to your IRA then we will contribute an additional 3% to match, doubling your actual contribution each pay period.

## Vacation Time

We utilize a *minimum time off* policy, whereby we require to you take at least 12 days of paid time off (PTO) per year.

As a remote company we all have a tendency to work too much and so we aim to create a healhier, and happier work-life balance for the entire crew. 

There is no maximum time off right now, we aim to instill trust in all employees. It is on each of us to use this benefit reasonably and give the team the respect we all deserve.
