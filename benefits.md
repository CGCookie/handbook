# Employee Benefits

This section is written for full-time employees of CG Cookie. 

## Health Insurance

Health and Dental insurance is provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO. Included in our compensation package, CG Cookie pays 100% of the premium. Open enrolment is in November each year with marriages and domestic partnerships covered equally.

## Vision
CG Cookie offers VSP insurance which includes a yearly eye exam + allowances for Frames or Contact Lenses. 

## IRA Retirement Plan

CG Cookie offers a matching SIMPLE IRA retirement plan, where we will match up to 3%. This means if you contribute 3% of your bi-weekly paycheck to your IRA then we will contribute an additional 3% to match, doubling your actual contribution each pay period, not to exceed $12,500 in a calendar year. Employees are immediatly vested, meaning that you may enroll immediately upon joining as a full-time crew member.

## Vacation Time

We offer 12 days of paid time off (PTO) per year, along with a handful of personal days to use as needed. This is paired with the 4-day work week. https://github.com/CGCookie/handbook/blob/master/how-we-work.md#4-day-work-week

As a remote company we all have a tendency to work too much and so we aim to create a healhier, and happier work-life balance for the entire crew.

## Full-time Annual Employee Bonus (We're all in this together) Plan. 
When CG Cookie passes our Net Profit goal for the calendar year, January 1st, through December 31st, 25% of that Net profit will be paid out to eligible employees based on the number of points employees have earned. Points are allocated based on years of service.
