## 401K Retirement Plan

CG Cookie offers a matching 401k retirement plan, where we will match up to 3%. This means if you contribute 3% of your bi-weekly paycheck to your IRA then we will contribute an additional 3% to match, doubling your actual contribution each pay period, not to exceed $12,500 in a calendar year. Employees are immediatly vested.

## Vacation Time

We utilize a *minimum time off* policy, whereby we require to you take at least 12 days of paid time off (PTO) per year.

As a remote company we all have a tendency to work too much and so we aim to create a healhier, and happier work-life balance for the entire crew. 

There is no maximum time off right now, we aim to instill trust in all employees. It is on each of us to use this benefit reasonably and give the team the respect we all deserve.

## 4-day work week

A healthy life/work balance is mission critical. Family always comes first and we aim to build that right into our business. One way of doing this is optional Fridays, providing a 4-day work week. 

The last thing we want is for anyone to burn out. Burn out is destructive (and avoidable).

This means our typical work week is 32 hours (no, you're not asked to put in longer days in exchange for Friday-off).

The exception to Fridays off, are for large project launches and other special events that require constant attention. These will always be communicated before hand.
