# Employee Benefits & Perks

This section is written for full-time employees of CG Cookie. 

## Health Insurance

Health and Dental insurance is provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO. Included in our compensation package, CG Cookie pays 100% of the premium. Open enrolment is in November each year with marriages and domestic partnerships covered equally.

## Vision
CG Cookie offers VSP insurance which includes a yearly eye exam + allowances for Frames or Contact Lenses. 

## 401k Retirement Plan

CG Cookie offers a matching 401k retirement plan, where we will match up to 4%. This means if you contribute 4% of your bi-weekly paycheck to your 401k then we will contribute an additional 4% to match, doubling your actual contribution each pay period, not to exceed $18,500 in a calendar year. Employees are immediatly vested, meaning that you may enroll immediately upon joining as a full-time crew member.

## Vacation Time

We offer 12 days of paid time off (PTO) per year, along with a handful of personal days to use as needed. This is paired with the 4-day work week. https://github.com/CGCookie/handbook/blob/master/how-we-work.md#4-day-work-week

As a remote company we all have a tendency to work too much and so we aim to create a healthier, and happier work-life balance for the entire crew.

## 4-day Work Week
A healthy life/work balance is mission-critical. Family always comes first and we aim to build that right into our business. CG Cookie works on a 4-day work week, with optional Fridays, effectively adding 52 additional paid days off for full-time employees (nearly 2 months).

The last thing we want is for anyone to burn out. Burn out is destructive (and avoidable).

This means our typical work week is 32 hours (no, you're not asked to put in longer days in exchange for Friday-off).

The exceptions to Fridays off, are for large project launches and other special events that require constant attention. These will always be communicated beforehand.

## Full-time Annual Employee Bonus (We're all in this together) Plan. 
When CG Cookie passes our Net Profit goal for the calendar year, January 1st, through December 31st, a percentage of that Net Profit will be paid out to eligible employees based on the number of points employees have earned. Points are allocated based on years of service.
